# Kindred Manga Library [ KML ]
Kindred Manga Library. View, Manage, download and stay up to date on your manga library.

I have looked for a manga library application to keep up with all of the manga that I am currently reading and could not find anything
that scarified me. This is how Kindred Manga Library (kml) was born.

Currently in development and is not ready for an official release.

## Development
KML is writen in in python 3.4 (writen for what PyQt4 is). To Build KML make sure that you have python 3.4 installed and run kml.py.
MAKE SURE that you also have the dependencies needed to build it.
